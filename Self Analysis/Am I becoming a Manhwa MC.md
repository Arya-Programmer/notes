I am being very good towards those who are close to me or are in my corcle of friends. And very bad towards those who I don't consider friends.
It is the same as a Manhwa MC who is overpowered deals with people in the same way.
Like for example, the MC from Demon Emperor.
Who is very good towards his friends and very bad towards others.

I think this is good in a way.
I am saying "in a way", because the bad side of it is that you are categorizing people which are not so simple.
I just don't feel comfortable with it.
#### I don't know why I feel comfortable
