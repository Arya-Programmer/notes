1. Features
2. Circuitry (Connection): I want two extra features *Arduino-connected* and *Easily-chargeable*
	1. Disconnectors: everything should be easy to **turn off** and/or **cutoff**
	2. Connection boxes: designed with a 3D printer
	3. Earth cable
	4. Rails/joints: so they can be easily changed
	5. Safety: MCB and SPD are needed
