# Marzluff on crows
Professor Marzluff did an experiment on crows, he put on a Halloween mask, amd trapped a few crows then banded them and after that released them into the Washington university's campus.
Later, the crows on campus (including the banded crows) attacked Marzluff whenever he wore the same mask. But they didn't attack when he changed his mask.
Their #Long_memory is also very amazing, as he was attacked by a crow that he had branded 10 years ago!

Crows are getting smarter.

In Japan, crows when the traffic light becomes red, the crows put walnut in front of the tires of the automobiles.

## Can they use tools to get tools to get food?
Yes they can. This a much more complex task, for humans, we made a great step in evolution by using a rock to break another rock to make a tool, and not the direct use of a given tool by nature.

## Crows use cloth hangers to make nests in Japan
They use cloth hangers as they are the right size, but this might lead to other problems, like making an unwanted electric short in subway systems electrical wires.
So they have made a special team to remove nests of crows on electrical powerlines, in hopes that they will learn and stop creating more.
