People in time, when they like a particular property of a person, they will start liking other parts of him, which might not be a good part. If you like someone it is better to know exactly which part it is you like, so that you won't fall into the mistake of liking the wrong parts of him because of a charming side of him.

For example, when one argues, he is very considerate of others how can you say he is lying, well you can be a liar while being considerate, that doesn't mean one good property means he is all good.
