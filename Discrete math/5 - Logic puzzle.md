 An island has two kinds of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie you og to the island and meet A and B. A says "B is a knight". B says, "The two of us are of opposite types" What are A and B?

p: A is a knight
q: B is a knight

### Getting to an Answer
$p \land q$                A is a knight        B is a knight
$p \land \neg q$             A is a knight         B is a knave
$\neg p \land q$              A is a knave         B is a knight
$\neg p \land \neg q$           A is a knave          B is a knave

The correct answer is $\neg p \land \neg q$.
Because... (Think about it yourself, I don't feel like typing all that out)
