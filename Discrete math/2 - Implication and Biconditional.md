Two more connectives:
1. if statement or an "Implication"
2. if and only if or an "Biconditional"

## Implication
An implication also sometimes called a *conditional statement*
Implication: When the hypothesis is true the conclusion must be true for the implication to be true.

### Denotation
p → q and red "if p then q" or "p implies q".

### Truth table
p: it is a holiday.
q: the store is closed.

| p | q | p → q |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |
When the hypothesis is False (p is false) the conclusion (p → q) will always be True
### Types of implication
- Converse   q → p
	- Basically swap the places of the propositions
- Inverse       ¬p → ¬q
	- Negate both.
- Contrapositive ¬q → ¬p
	- Swap and Negate.
	- Will have the same truth table as the original implication (p → q)

### Example
p: it is raining.
q: I won't go to town.
p → q: If it is raining then I won't go to town.

#### Converse
q → p: if I don't go to town then it is raining.

#### Inverse
¬p → ¬q: If it is not raining then I will go to town.

#### Contrapositive
¬q → ¬p: If I go to town then it is not raining.


### Example - 2
p: you complete your homework.
q: professor B is happy.
p → q: If you complete your homework then professor B is happy.

#### Converse
q → p: if professor B is happy then you completed your homework.

#### Inverse
¬p → ¬q: If you don't complete your homework, then professor B won't be happy.

#### Contrapositive
¬q → ¬p: If professor B is not happy, then you did not complete your homework.



## Biconditional
Biconditional: when both propositions are the same, then it is true. (like and)

### Denotation
p ↔ q and its read "p if and only if q"

### Truth table

| p | q | p ↔ q |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | T |

**Note:** (p → q) ∧ (q → P) ≡ (p ↔ q) is True.
