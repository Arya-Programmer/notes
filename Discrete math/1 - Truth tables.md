# Connective
We have studied three connectives and the last two we haven't discussed:
1. ¬ which means "not" is a **negation**.
2. ∧ which means "and" is a **conjunction**.
3. ∨ which means "or" is a **disjunction**.
4. → which means "if" is an **implication**.
5. ↔ which means  "if and only if" is a **biconditional**.

One more connective is "exclusive or" abbreviated as "xor".
#### proposition:
You get soup or salad with your entree.
you get soup: **p**
you get salad: **q**
#### Truth table:

| p | q | p ∨ q | p ⊕ q |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| T | T | T | F |
| T<br> | F | T | T |
| F | T | T | T |
| F | F | F | F |
==Exclusive or:== only returns true when one of the two propositions is true and not both.
